# LORE

**Linked Object Retrieval Engine** — a personal knowledge server that speaks [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

> Research preview. The API surface may change between versions.

Store facts, relate them as a knowledge graph, and retrieve them with hybrid search — all from any MCP client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, etc.). Runs on Cloudflare Workers with zero ongoing cost at personal scale.

## Why

LLM assistants forget everything between sessions. LORE gives them a shared, persistent memory they can read from and write to through the Model Context Protocol. Entries carry provenance (source, actor, confidence) so the assistant — or you — can judge how trustworthy a piece of knowledge is.

## Capabilities

### Tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `store` | Create a knowledge entry with optional provenance |
| `update` | Update an existing entry |
| `query` | Hybrid search: FTS5 lexical + Vectorize semantic + graph expansion |
| `delete` | Soft-delete an entry or triple |
| `relate` | Create a graph triple with conflict detection |
| `query_graph` | Query triples by subject / predicate / object |
| `update_triple` | Update an existing triple |
| `upsert_triple` | Create-or-update a triple by subject+predicate |
| `resolve_conflict` | Resolve a detected triple conflict (replace / retain_both / reject) |
| `upsert_entity` | Create or resolve a canonical entity by name |
| `merge_entities` | Merge two canonical entities |
| `undo` | Revert recent transactions |
| `history` | View transaction history |
| `ingest` | Bulk-ingest text (sync for small inputs, async for large) |
| `ingestion_status` | Check async ingestion progress |
| `time` | Current time in any IANA timezone |

**Retrieval pipeline.** Queries run three signals in parallel and merge them with configurable weights (default 0.3 / 0.5 / 0.2):

1. **Lexical** — FTS5 with BM25 scoring (falls back to LIKE if FTS5 is unavailable)
2. **Semantic** — Vectorize nearest-neighbor over `bge-base-en-v1.5` embeddings (skipped when bindings are absent)
3. **Graph** — 1-hop neighborhood expansion via the triple store

When Vectorize is not bound, semantic weight is redistributed to lexical and graph automatically.

**Conflict detection.** When `relate` would create a triple with the same subject+predicate but a different object, LORE pauses and returns a `ConflictInfo` for the client to resolve via `resolve_conflict`.

**Undo.** Every mutation records a before/after snapshot in the transaction log. `undo` replays the inverse, including full reversal of entity merges.

## Quick Start

### One-click deploy

1. Click the button and follow the Cloudflare prompts.
2. Set `ACCESS_PASSPHRASE` when prompted (required).
3. Visit `https://<your-worker>.workers.dev/authorize`, enter your passphrase.
4. On first login, scan the TOTP QR code with your authenticator app and verify.
5. Connect your MCP client (see below).

### Connect from Claude Desktop

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "lore": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://<your-worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Connect from Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http lore https://<your-worker>.<subdomain>.workers.dev/mcp
```

## Auth

Single-owner, two-factor:

- **Passphrase** — set via `ACCESS_PASSPHRASE` secret
- **Passkey** (WebAuthn) — preferred 2FA, enrolled after first passphrase login
- **TOTP** — fallback 2FA, enrolled via QR code if passkey is skipped
- **Cloudflare Access** (optional) — adds an email-based identity layer with JWT verification

Security details:
- CSRF tokens on all auth forms
- One-time nonces for OAuth requests and enrollment flows (KV with TTL)
- Timing-safe comparison for passphrase and TOTP
- IP-based lockout after 5 failed attempts (15-minute window, shared across all auth methods)
- Security headers: CSP (with nonce for passkey JS), HSTS, X-Frame-Options, no-store

To reset credentials:
```bash
npx wrangler kv key delete --binding OAUTH_KV "ks:passkey:cred"   # reset passkey
npx wrangler kv key delete --binding OAUTH_KV "ks:totp:secret"    # reset TOTP
```

## Local Development

```bash
bun install
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars   # set ACCESS_PASSPHRASE in .dev.vars
npx wrangler dev
```

Run tests:
```bash
bun test
```

## Observability

Structured JSON events are emitted via `console.log` and auto-indexed by [Cloudflare Workers Logs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/observability/logs/):

| Event | Fields |
|---|---|
| `mutation` | `op`, `id`, `ok` |
| `retrieval` | `mode`, `results`, `ms` |
| `conflict` | `scope`, `conflict_id` |
| `conflict_resolved` | `conflict_id`, `strategy`, `triple_id` |
| `policy_rejection` | `op`, `reason`, `field` or `confidence` |

## Eval Suite

```bash
bun run evals/run.ts
```

Seeds 30 entries + 12 triples, runs 12 queries, and computes ndcg@10, mrr@10, recall@20, and latency p95. CI fails if metrics regress beyond thresholds.

Baseline (FTS5-only, no Vectorize): ndcg=0.38, mrr=0.66, recall=0.29. Semantic search via Vectorize is expected to close the gap on the 4 deliberate misses in the eval set.

## Updates

[![Update from Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Update_from_Source-blue?logo=github)](../../actions/workflows/manual-update.yml)

Click the badge above (or go to **Actions → Manual Update → Run workflow**) to pull the latest version from upstream and redeploy.

**Prerequisites** (one-time setup in your fork's **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**):

| Secret | Description |
|---|---|
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | API token with Workers + D1 edit permissions |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | Your Cloudflare account ID |

If the secrets are missing, the sync still runs but the deploy step is skipped.

Two workflows are included:

- **Manual Update** — click "Run workflow" to force-sync from upstream and redeploy
- **Auto Update Control** (opt-in) — enable/disable daily scheduled upstream sync

## Known Limitations

- **Single-owner only.** One passphrase, one TOTP secret, one user.
- **No multi-tenant isolation.** All data lives in one D1 database.
- **LIKE wildcards not escaped.** `%` and `_` in search input are passed through to SQL LIKE clauses.
- **Vectorize requires separate setup.** Semantic search only works when AI and Vectorize bindings are configured in wrangler.jsonc.
- **D1 row size limit.** Async ingestion caps content at ~900KB per task. For larger inputs, pre-chunk and call `store` individually.
