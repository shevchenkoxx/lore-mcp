	"note": "Baseline for FTS5-only search (no Vectorize in CI). 30 entries, 12 queries, 12 triples. MISSes on paraphrased queries (type system, async runtime, development tools, performance optimization) demonstrate the gap that semantic search (Vectorize) would fill. MRR < 1.0 because 4/12 queries return zero results. Recall is low because FTS5 MATCH requires lexical overlap — conceptual matches need embeddings."
